# isHUD - An OSX Head-up Display for input sources

## Why
As a multilanguage Mac OS X user, I use the default shortcut keys (Command+Space, Option+Command+Space) to switch between input sources. But when I press Option+Command+Space (Select the next input source), the system wild input source overlay doesn't appear. With the Lion's new cool stuff, fullscreen mode, it's inconvenient for me to check the current input source.

With isHUD, everytime you change the input source, a HUD will appear right in the middle of the screen, which means there's no more need to move your eye to check the input source.
